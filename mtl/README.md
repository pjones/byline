Byline simplifies writing interactive command-line applications by
building upon [ansi-terminal][] and [haskeline][]. This makes it
possible to print messages and prompts that include terminal escape
sequences such as colors that are automatically disabled when standard
input is a file. It also means that Byline works on both
POSIX-compatible systems and on Windows.

The primary features of Byline include printing messages, prompting
for input, and generating custom menus. It was inspired by the
[highline] Ruby library and the [terminal library][] by Craig Roche.

## Example Using `MonadByline`

```haskell
example :: MonadByline m => m Text
example = do
  sayLn ("Hey, I like " <> ("Haskell" <> fg magenta) <> "!")

  let question =
        "What's "
          <> ("your" <> bold)
          <> " favorite "
          <> ("language" <> fg green <> underline)
          <> "? "

  askLn question (Just "Haskell")
```
